# Environment

## Description

The Dadela Environment is the system (programming language or application)
that hosts Dadela's components and capabilities,
sets the execution limitations and defines the integration details for sources and destinations.

## Notes

* If the Environment is a programming language, it should provide methods/functions
for a bi-directional integration for processing the created/inserted records.
